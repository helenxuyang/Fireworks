# Fireworks
AOOD art project - simple interactive program where you can click and scroll to make a fireworks show

For our first project in Advanced Object Oriented Design, we were assigned to use graphics classes in Java to create an artistic and/or interactive program. I created an interactive firework show where the user can scroll to change their selected color and hold the mouse down to set off fireworks. Each firework contains particles that travel on a random path, which used some basic kinematics.
